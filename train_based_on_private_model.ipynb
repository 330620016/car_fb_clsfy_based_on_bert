       " ('robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales.  robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates sunday s set-to with france at twickenham. lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems. and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat. olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour. the bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against france  with either tait or noon dropping out.  tait  given little opportunity to shine in attack  received praise from robinson afterwards  even if the coach admitted cardiff was an  unforgiving place  for the teenage prodigy. robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line  after just one outing  a player he regards as central to england s future. tait himself  at least outwardly  appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular.  i want more of that definitely   he said.  hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we ll have to look at the video and wait and see.  we were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. i thought we defended reasonably well but we ve just got to pick it up for france.   his newcastle team-mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test. he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build-up to wales  try  conceded a penalty at the breakdown  was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson s cross-kick into touch  all inside the first quarter. his contribution improved in the second half  but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. up front  the line-out remains fallible  despite a superb performance from chris jones  whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody. it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards  with andy hazell likely to make way. lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side  but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground.',\n",

       " ('kelly trails new discipline power teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a  zero tolerance  drive  education secretary ruth kelly has suggested.  ms kelly told the bbc progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems. the minister also confirmed she received  spiritual support  from the catholic movement opus dei. but she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs.  the conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the run-up to the next general election. ms kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight. she told bbc one s breakfast with frost:  it is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom.  we have made huge progress on the really difficult cases  the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour.   but quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled.  i would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision.  it is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes. head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school  who sexually abuse pupils or other people  who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour. ms kelly entered the cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then home secretary david blunkett. her links to opus dei  which means  work of god  in latin  have provoked controversy.  critics say the organisation  which adheres strictly to catholic teachings  is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims. asked if she was a member of the group  ms kelly said:  i do have spiritual support from opus dei and that is right.  but those are private spiritual matters and i m sure you ll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life.  she categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister. her collective responsibility as a cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas  she argued.  the government has yet to issue its official response to the tomlinson review  which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma. ms kelly said reforms should build on gcses and a-levels. her comments did not impress tory shadow education secretary tim collins.  ruth kelly wants to ditch the tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place   he said.  she also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how. this is an all talk agenda that lets down children  teachers and parents.',\n",
